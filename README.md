Math:
- Kelvin and Rankine are absolute scales that start at 0 and go up, they cannot be negative
- Celsius and Fahrenheit are relative scales to the freezing and boiling points of water. They do
  have negative values, and they do have minimum values below which are not physically possible.
  Water freezes at 0 degrees on both scales, but boils at 100 degrees C and 212 degrees fahrenheit.
- The size of a Kelvin and a Celcius degree are the same
- The size of a Rankine and a Fahrenheit degree are the same
